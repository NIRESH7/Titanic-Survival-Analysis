🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

Technologies Used: SQL | Excel | Power BI

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of the Titanic dataset, leveraging SQL for querying and preprocessing, Excel for data exploration and transformation, and Power BI for building an interactive and insightful dashboard.

📌 Project Summary

The objective of this project is to analyze passenger data from the Titanic to uncover patterns and insights related to survival. By examining variables such as gender, age, class, fare, and embarkation point, we aim to answer key questions and visually communicate the findings through dynamic dashboards.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL – Data extraction, filtering, and transformation

Microsoft Excel – Exploratory analysis and data cleanup

Power BI – Dashboard creation and visual storytelling

📈 Key Insights

Women and children had a significantly higher survival rate compared to men.

Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.

Lower survival rates were observed among passengers who paid less and boarded from Southampton.
